What's for Dinner: a silly recipe generator from the ingredients in your fridge!
This is the final project by Hillary Dunkley (class of 2025) for CSC 151: Application of Computer Science Concepts at Smith College, taught by Johanna Brewer (@deadroxy)
The final project is a Ruby on Rails web application. 
To run this application, you will need to have Ruby on Rails installed, as well as MySQL. The application can run on any browser (Google Chrome, Safari, Brave). 
First, fork this github and clone it locally to your computer. 
The application can be launched by going to the terminal, typing cd whats-for-dinner, then rails s (or rails server).
